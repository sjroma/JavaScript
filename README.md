# JavaScript  
### How is JavaScript different from Java?  
* The JavaScript programming language, developed by Netscape, Inc., is not part of the Java platform.  
* JavaScript does not create applets or stand-alone applications. In its most common form, JavaScript resides inside HTML documents, and can provide levels of interactivity to web pages that are not achievable with simple HTML.  
* Key differences between Java and JavaScript:  
   * Java is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language.  
   * Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.  
   * Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.  
   * They require different plug-ins.
