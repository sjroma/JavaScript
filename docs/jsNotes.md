# JavaScript notes
* **console.log** - Almost every language has a simple way to "print" text, and the simplest way in JS is a function known as console.log. While it's part of a more complex tool called **console**, we'll use it only for printing text.
* **;** - You'll see most lines of JS end with a semicolon which helps the language determine where one statement ends and another begins.  Semicolons can be a deep topic of discussion but we'll keep things simple: end every line with a semicolon, unless specifically told not to.  Semicolons aren't always necessary, but they're a good habit of people new to JS, so they're used in this tutorial.
* **//** - Like most languages, JS allows you to add notes to your code, also known as comments. We'll use the double slashes in the examples.  Anything after the double slashes on that same line will be ignore by the browser. 

* Variable names can't
  * start with a number
  * include spaces or hyphens
  * be reserved works like "**return**", "**if**", "**else**", "**for**", etc. 
  
* Variable names can
  * contain the special characters "**$**" and "**_**"
  * can contain upper and lowercase letters \(note that they are case sensitive meaning **var Car** is different than **var car**\)
  * include digits, except as the first character
 
###Primitive Data Types
* JavaScript supports many types of data and each has its own unique meaning and syntax.  *Primitive data types* are those that are fundamental to storing the simplest data, like numbers and letters.  The following table shows some of the primitive data types available in the JavaScript language.
| Type | Syntax |
| ---  |   ---  |
| Number | 1, 200, 3.14159 |
| String | "hello there!", 'hello there!' |
| Boolean | true , false |
| Undefined | undefined |
